	<!-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHANGING FONTS:
	Replace "/Assets/Fonts/Replacers/#Aller" with "/Assets/Fonts/Replacers/#YOURFONTNAME"
	"YOURFONTNAME" can be any fonts in the GUI/Assets/Fonts/Replacers folder.
	Be sure to use the font's actual Font Name exactly, including any spaces that may be present. 
	
	If using one of your own fonts, place the font file in the Assets/Fonts/Replacers folder.
	Then, double-click the font file to view the Font Name in the top-left corner of that window, and copy its
	exact spelling when replacing the "Aller" font below. 
	
	If you mess this up, the game will not display text at all, so close the game and come back to this file
	and correct the error. Once you're done editing the file, make sure to save it as the same filename
	(Keyboard.Fonts.xaml). That's it! Enjoy your new fonts in BG3!

    <FontFamily x:Key="DefaultFont" >/Assets/Fonts/Replacers/#JS Chawlewhieng</FontFamily>
    <FontFamily x:Key="SpecialFont" >/Assets/Fonts/Replacers/#JS Chawlewhieng</FontFamily>
	
	<!-- NOTE: The "SpecialFont" is not really used in-game, but you are welcome to replace the font value
	on this line to any font of your choosing if you'd like to try and find where it is used.
