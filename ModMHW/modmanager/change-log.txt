- Re-organized the options menu by adding an "advanced options" menu which includes the more technical or unusual settings.
- Added toggles to the advanced options menu which adds prompts for mod installs and uninstalls.
- Added code for outputting error messages for when Curl (library used for version checking and downloads) fails. These error messages are logged to Data\Log.txt
- Re-compiled Curl to allow for downloading from secure websites. Since that's supported now I've changed all addresses to my website to use HTTPS. It's possible only this and newer versions of the Mod Manager will be able to use download functionality, so it's highly recommended all users upgrade to this.
- Added basic functionality for verifying file integrity of downloaded files.
- Improved behaviour when Fluffy Manager window is resized while the mod list is open. However, this is very much a work-in-progress and I'll continue to improve this behaviour so every part of the UI resizes appropriately as you resize the window.

v2.230: (2020-11-23)
- Optimized GPU usage. If nothing is being animated (or if the program is out of focus) then GPU usage becomes 0%.
- Added support for Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2.
- SC6: Updated trainer to work with latest version (works as of 2020-10-17).
- SC6: Updated trainer to show more music track options.
- SC6: Trainer will disable controller ID menu options if address for it doesn't work (ie, for when a new SC6 version is released).
- Save manager: Added support for more games. RE1 HD, RE0, RE4, RE5, RE6, Revelations 1, and Revelations 2.
- Save manager: Did a lot of miscellaneous changes. Added toggle for displaying date of save files, added buttons for opening save locations in Windows File Explorer, added prompts when performing any action resulting in overwriting a save file, and change the menu layout for the save manager.
- The "Define game path" button now only appears if the mod manager lacks the install path for the currently selected game.
- The mod manager now allows replacement of the game executable. Note that the mod manager can't check if a game is patched while the game executable is replaced, so keep this in mind (you might need to reinstall the game if the game gets patched while you have it modded like this).
- Fixed a rare bug which could lead to the mod manager failing to copy over a file from a second mod when uninstalling a mod which modded the same files as another installed mod.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the "Uninstall all mods" button from updating its state when browsing the addon menu for a mod.
- When clicking on "Uninstall all mods" while browsing the addon menu for a mod you will no longer get reset to the full mod list.
- Improved handling of starting Fluffy Manager 5000 when an instance of it is already running.
- Added a better notification for when mod downloads finish.
- Improved error handling for failed loading of PKG archives.
- Fixed a bug with Windows 10 version 2004 where quitting the mod manager while it's on a second monitor will make it freeze when restarting the mod manager.
- Added support for the game Ghostrunner.
- Fixed drag'n'drop feature which broke when fixing a bug related to Windows 10 v2004.
- Fixed a bug which could potentially show info about a downloadable mod while in a puzzle minigame.
- Releases of Fluffy Manager no longer includes assets for wallpapers and minigames, and these are now optional downloads via the Fluffy Manager. This makes the initial download much smaller.
- There's now a system in place for automating the downloading and updating of new versions of Fluffy Manager.
- Log.txt will now be created in "Data" directory in order to make the root directory for Fluffy Manager less messy. Feel free to delete log.txt if it already exists.
- Added a new entry to the help prompt for the save manager when Dragon's Dogma is selecting warning about how pawn hires will get rewards reset to 0 for a set amount of time after swapping savegame.
- Fixed an issue where Fluffy Manager would get confused by its focus status if the user changed to another program while Fluffy Manager was initializing (this meant it could be receiving input when it shouldn't).
- Fixed a bug which could make Fluffy Manager think an old version was up-to-date when doing online version checking.
- Clicking on "Refresh mod list" will no longer reset the currently selected category filter.
- Rewrote the framerate limiter as it didn't work very well on newer versions of Windows (this should result in the mod manager feeling a bit more responsive).

v2.220: (2020-05-09)
- Fixed a bug which sometimes prevented the mod author categories from working when browsing downloadable mods.
- Made more games hidden by default (only applies to new users of the mod manager). You can always click "Show / hide games" to customize which games are shown and hidden.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the help icon from appearing.
- Added a lot more help information which can be accessed via pressing the help icon or pressing F1.
- Fixed a bug which could prevent mods in RAR files without a modinfo.ini from appearing in the mod list.
- Added support for multiple mods to be contained in one RAR file (for this to work, you'll need to add multiple subfolders and make sure each one has a modinfo.ini).
- The above feature required a rewrite of a lot of code handling mods in RAR archives. One side effect is that the mod manager will have to re-create the cache for many RAR archives, which could result in a brief delay. If you have mods installed, a few of them might end up getting shown twice in the list (that's fixed by uninstalling and reinstaling the mods).
- The mod manager will now automatically re-read game archives if a game patch is detected while no mods are installed.
- Fixed a bug where if you only had mods with addons in the mod list the mod manager would display the message "no mods found."
- Fixed a bug where the wrong menu button would be pressed after showing a list of mod addons and clicking left mouse button without moving the mouse.
- Added a button to the mod downloader to a site where you can post feedback on the mods downloadable via the mod manager.
- Redid the interface for showing mod downloads in progress.
- Added support for Code Vein.
- Added support for Trials of Mana.

v2.211:
- RE Resistance: Launch game button now tries to launch the full game, rather than the open beta.
- When certain features are unavailable for the selected game (jukebox, trainer, puzzle, or save manager) the button for it will disappear rather than appear grayed out.
- When installing mods, the "invalidated paths" text now says "modified paths."
- Fixed a bug which could result in a mod download failing (happened if a mod with same filename exists and its screenshot was recently loaded).
- The mod manager now refuses to install/uninstall mods for any game if the game is currently running. Add "CheckIfGameIsRunningForModInstalls: 0" to config.ini to override this behaviour.
- SC6: Updated trainer to work with latest patch (works as of 2020/04/16).

v2.210: (2020-04-03)
- Added support for Resident Evil 3 and RE: Resistance.

v2.200: (2020-01-23)
- SC6: Updated the trainer to support "AI difficulty change" and changing of controller IDs with v2.00 of the game (also works with v2.02, and hopefully future versions).
- SC6: Updated the music part of the trainer to include SC4, Broken Destiny, and SC5 soundtracks.
- Improved display of warning when a game is patched while mods are installed.
- RE2: Updated trainer to work with the latest patch.
- Made mod installs using RE Engine games to correctly check against both hashes of each file entry in PAK files. Earlier versions only compared against one hash which prevented 2 files from being modable in DMC5.
- Added "Download Mods" button with some direct mod downloads and some links to popular mod sites. (Since mods can be directly downloaded via the mod manager, I've removed the mods which were bundled with the mod manager.)
- Added Resident Evil 3 support in the mod manager! (but it doesn't actually support RE3 yet)

v2.115: (2019-11-24)
- Made the "Trainer" GUI button lead directly to the "Trainer functions" menu if the trainer has managed to hook into the game.
- Mod manager will no longer display mod conflicts when hovering over an installed mod (might remove some stutter when browsing the mod list).

- RE6: Fixed missing text in a few trainer options.
- RE6: "Player stats" and "Lobby info" trainer menus have been combined into one called "Player info."
- Added option to align menu button text in mod list to "left" or "middle."

- Mod categories in the "Tag filter" menu are now sorted alphabetically.
- Added "Installed" category to the "Tag filter" menu.
- "Tag filter" menu now shows quantity of mods currently using each category tag.
- Clicking "Mod list" now always resets category tag selection to default (which is "all").
- Screenshot feature. Press F12 key to take a screenshot which will be saved as a PNG file in the "Screenshots" directory.
- SC6: Added a trainer. Lets you change stage music and AI difficulty.
- Fixed a minor issue where a "previous menu" menu button wouldn't work as intended if you opened the trainer menu while in the mod list menu.
- Cleaned up the "Trainer options" menu.
- SC6: Added a wallpaper for the game.
- SC6: Added a feature to the trainer letting you force 1P and 2P to always be human-controlled.
- SC6: Added a feature to the trainer letting you remove the inherent 1-frame input lag found in all offline modes. This was discovered thanks to WAZAAAAA and there's more information here: https://8wayrun.com/threads/mod-to-reduce-offline-input-lag-on-pc-by-1-frame.20979/

- Mod manager now defaults to showing the mod list menu whenever you change game.

- The mod manager will now accept to install files from a mod's "root" directory. It will copy any file EXCEPT for the following:

-- modinfo.ini
-- *.txt
-- *.rtf
-- *.jpg
-- *.jpeg
-- *.psd
-- *.png
-- *.tga
-- *.bmp
-- *.gif
-- *.url
- Fixed a bug which would sometimes lead to mod installs failing due to game archives not being read even when a game was selected without needing game archives read.

v2.112: (2019-08-11)
- Added a warning if the mod manager loads a modinfo.ini in unicode format (this is not supported, and those should always be saved as ANSI).

- Made it possible to drag'n'drop mod RAR files directly onto the Mod Manager window which makes it move the RAR file into the corresponding directory for currently selected game.
- For UE4 games (ie, Bloodstained and SoulCalibur 6), you can drag'n'drop a PAK file onto the Mod Manager window.
- When creating UE4 pak files, you can store a modinfo.ini and screenshot.jpg at the root directory to make the Mod Manager load them.

v2.000: (2019-06-06)
- Added caching system for mods which makes mod manager much faster to start up when there are a large amount of mods (first time running the mod manager without cache may make it stall for a few seconds as it creates the cache).
- Added scroll bar for menus.

v1-56: (2014-03-02)
- Fixed major bug with installing mods. Sorry! If you're still having trouble, you might want to reinstall the game (make sure to manually delete game directory after uninstalling the game). The problem is caused by previous version making directories with same names as filenames, making the files fail to copy over.
- Added basic trainer support for RE4 HD. The trainer pokes lets you change money count, toggle infinite ammo, change character/outfit, change player opacity and change player speed.
- The code does not currently check for RE4 game version, so once Capcom patches the game, the trainer functions will stop working.

- Added a menu for viewing information about current lobby (how many players, if they're ready, etc).
- Changed the system for handling 6 player in no mercy. Turn on the poke for "host 6 player no mercy" any time before creating the lobby. It'll automatically freeze timer as a form of anti-cheat for other people joining the game.

v1-52: (2014-02-13)
- Fixed executable name.
- Fixed Player Stats menu.

v1-51: (2014-02-12)

- Added a new menu which shows both installed and installable mods. Old menus are still available in the main menu->mod manager menu.
- Added a new poke which forces characters to speak with a specific voice set. The options are: quiet, normal, loud and weak.
- Will only hook after RE6 process has been running for a while. This should fix a rare bug when hooking onto RE6.
- PlayerStats shows some additional stats during Mercenaries.
- Improved anti-cheat.

- Added proper icons and title to program.
- Added more fluffiness to program.
- Names for mods in menus now use "name=" from modinfo.ini if it exists.
- If install dir for Revelations or RE6 isn't defined in config, it'll try a couple of default install paths automatically.
